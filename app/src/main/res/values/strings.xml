    <string name="hello_blank_fragment">Hello blank fragment</string>
    <string name="front_yard">You are standing in your front yard next to your mailbox, when a sudden cold realization creeps over you.
        You forgot to bring your house key with you to school. Your parents don\'t get home from work for hours.
        In a sigh of exasperation you decide to start scouring for a way in.</string>
    <string name="back_yard">Your back yard stretches before you, freshly cut... last week.
        A sliding back door sits on this side of the house as well as a small window, and a normal sized one to the right of that.
        A ladder rests against the house next to it. That doesn\'t seem very safe.</string>
    <string name="tool_shed">You follow the pathway to the side of the house that has your dad\'s tool shed.
        It\'s about the size of a closet, but has a very sturdy lockable door. Another window rests on this side of the house as well.</string>
    <string name="front_door">You step onto your porch where a white door stands in front of you accompanied by an old welcome mat.
        A window to your left gives you a slight glipse of the video game console you wish you were currently playing.</string>
