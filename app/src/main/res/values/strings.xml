        cold realization creeps over you. You forgot to bring your house key with you to school.

        against the house next to it. Your dad has a pile of junk he needs to get to the dump stacked
        against the fence. The only thing of note is an old ladder.</string>

        remembered to close it last night.</string>
    <string name="front_door">You step onto your porch where a white door stands in front of you
